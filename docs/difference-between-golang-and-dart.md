# 戈朗和达特的区别

[Go](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/go-programming-language-introduction/) 是一种过程编程语言。它于 2007 年由罗伯特·格里森、罗布·派克和肯·汤普森在谷歌开发，但于 2009 年作为开源编程语言推出。程序通过使用包来组装，以便有效地管理依赖关系。这种语言也支持环境采用与动态语言相似的模式。Go 在语法上类似于 C，但具有内存安全、垃圾收集、结构类型和 CSP 风格的并发性。围棋又称**戈朗。**

[Dart](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-dart-programming-language/) 也是最初由谷歌开发的开源编程语言。它既适用于服务器端，也适用于用户端。Dart SDK 附带了它的编译器——Dart 虚拟机和一个实用工具 dart2js，该工具旨在生成 Dart 脚本的 Javascript 等价物，以便它可以在不支持 Dart 的网站上运行。Dart 支持面向对象的编程特性，如类、对象、接口等。

| Go is a concurrent and procedural programming language. | Dart is an object-oriented programming language. |
| Go is used for programming across large-scale network servers and large-scale distributed systems. | Nowadays Dart is widely used to develop mobile applications. |
| Go does not contain classes with constructors and destructors. | Dart does contain classes with constructors and destructors. |
| Go language provides automatic garbage collection for memory allocation. | Garbage collection is automatically performed by Dart VM. |
| Go language contains pointers, but not arithmetic pointers. | Dart also contains pointers, without arithmetic pointers. |
| In Go language, maps are passed by reference. | In the dart diagram, it is transmitted by numerical value. |
| Function overloading and custom operators are not supported. | Dart also does not support function overloading or user-defined operators. |
| It does not support constants or variable qualifiers. | Dart supported constants and default values are not included in this list, because future versions of Dart may support non-constant default values. |
| It does not use header files. Instead of using header files, use packages. It uses import to import external packages. | Dart also uses bags. |
| It has no while or do-while statement. But the for loop can be used as a while loop. | 镖有在…期间和边做边看语句。 |
| 去包含 goroutines 和频道. | Dart/Flutter is single-threaded and cannot share global variables. |
| Go does not support inheritance. But it provides another option in the form of embedding. | Dart supports inheritance. |
