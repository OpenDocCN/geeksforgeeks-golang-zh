# Golang 和 PHP 的区别

> 原文:[https://www . geesforgeks . org/golang 和-php 之间的区别/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-golang-and-php/)

[Golang](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/go-programming-language-introduction/) 是由 Robert Griesemer 先生、Rob Pike 先生和 Ken Thompson 先生在谷歌总部发明的一种静态类型化、编译的编程语言。其开发始于 2007 年，并于 2009 年向公众开放。它是开源的，免费提供给公众使用。如果我们看一下它的代码语法，它与 C 和 C++编程语言是一致的。这就是为什么，Golang 具有其他现代编程语言的许多特性，比如方法和运算符重载、指针和继承。它还提供了并发机制，使得开发面向多核和网络机器级的程序变得容易。这是一种解释的快速执行语言，具有丰富的健壮库。

[PHP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php/) 是一种服务器脚本语言，特别用于开发网站和基于网络的应用程序。它主要是由丹麦裔加拿大人先生在 1994 年开发的。PHP 速度快、灵活，是世界上网络开发领域使用最多的语言之一。PHP 是一种开源语言，可免费用于商业用途。它用于开发快速静态网站、动态网站和基于网络的应用程序。像 Tumblr、维基百科、Flickr、WordPress 等顶级公司都在使用 PHP。

### Golang vs PHP

| --- | --- |
| Golang can be used for fast machine code compilation. It includes garbage collection, memory security, structure type and concurrency. It was created by Google. | PHP is a server-based scripting language for developing robust and responsive web-based applications. |
| Golang supports signed and unsigned integers, and Go has separate arrays and mapping types. | PHP only supports signed integers, and PHP array is actually an ordered mapping. |
| Golang is a static type language, that is, the types of variables are known at compile time. | PHP is a dynamically typed language, which becomes a plus point, because you don't need to write data types when variables are created, and it will be automatically known by the compiler at runtime. |
| Grant didn't cycle for a while. Instead, Golang uses the for loop to execute the while loop. | There is a while loop in PHP. |
| Golang is not an object-oriented language and does not provide classes to use, but we can use it as an object-oriented language to some extent by using structs. Methods can be added to the structure. | PHP is a pure object-oriented language, which has all the characteristics of oops such as class, object, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. |
